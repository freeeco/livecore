# LiveCore: Increasing Liveness in a Low-level Dataflow Programming Environment

Poster presented by David Alexander ([@freeeco](https://github.com/freeeco)) and Jack Armitage ([@jarmitage](https://github.com/jarmitage)) at [Audio Mostly 2019](https://audiomostly.com), University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.

## Introduction

Liveness is an important factor in live coding but frequently liveness focuses on high-level, textual environments.
While these environments offer many abstraction capabilities, users of low-level dataflow programming environments could also benefit from increased liveness.
In this work we introduce LiveCore: a macro library for the low-level dataflow environment [Reaktor Core](https://www.native-instruments.com/fileadmin/ni_media/downloads/manuals/REAKTOR_6_Building_in_Core_English_2015_11.pdf) enabling live coding.
LiveCore manages program state at audio rates and provides a suite of modules for musical pattern generation, sequencing and synthesis.
LiveCore increases liveness in Reaktor Core from an editable dataflow program, to one with continuous audio suitable for musical performance.
